<h1>Information</h1>

Installing it is as simple as running the .exe file found in the releases.

I recommend placing the .exe in the Windows Startup folder so the program starts automatically every time you boot your computer.

For Windows 10/11, the path is:  
`%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

To type `<` and `>`, on a keyboard with a US layout, you’ll need to press `CTRL + <` / `CTRL + >`.
